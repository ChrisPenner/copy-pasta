Use at your own risk. I use it daily without trouble, and have tried my best to make it safe to use, but I'm not responsible if it causes you to delete files by accident. Cheers!

Copy Pasta is a shell utility which let's you copy and paste in your terminal as you're used to doing in your GUI.

It works like this:

```sh
# Copy some files
copy cool-file.txt best-dir-around/

# Take your time looking around and find your destination
cd ../../some-other-place
cd other-cool-subdir

# 'pasta' to dump what you've copied into your current working directory
pasta
```

Copy Pasta doesn't pollute your clipboard, and even works across different terminals!

I use it a lot when I have two tmux panes open for different projects and I just want to copy-paste some files over, I can `copy *` in one pane, switch panes, then `pasta`!

## Compatibility

Copy Pasta should work on most linux and mac machines, and works with most bash-compatible shells.

## Installation options:

* copy-paste `copy-pasta.plugin.zsh` onto your machine and source it from your shell's `rc` file. (E.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`)
* Add to your ZSH plugin manager as `ChrisPenner/copy-pasta`

## Usage

```
Usage:

  copy <files and directories to copy>

  pasta [destination dir]
    If destination dir is omitted the current directory is used.
    If the destination dir does not exist it will be created.
```
